ISBN:- 978-1-5090-4890-8, Page Nos: 1080-1082.</p>
		<p><b>About My Publication:</b> The Braille script to voice conversion explores a wearable messaging device that uses embedded technology for visually impaired person. The main objective of this project is to establish a means of communication for specially abled people. It has a special keyboard that is integrated with the braille for the use of blind. It converts the message that the person wants to communicate to other person into a voice and text, so that he understands what the blind and dumb intend to say. It is the first of its kind that would be of great help to the specially abled, as blindness is considered to be the highest of all other disabilities. One can build communication between blind and dumb people and the community by using this Braille system. Moreover, the system is implemented on the open source Arduino platform which makes it more efficient and also cost effective.</p>
